# **Let's talk Travel!**

Traveling is more than moving from one geographical place to another, I would describe it as a lifestyle. For the true wanderlust, it is simply invaluable where one gets to experience different cultures, sights, people and to some a lot of retrospection. Whatever the reasons for traveling are, be it work, vacation or any other, it should be quite memorable. 

## Where to start?
From my interaction with people, when asked why they don't or have never traveled they are usually quick to point cost and time. However, traveling is not expensive.The reason for this misconception stems from the idea of distant places, for example, a friend was telling me the other day how he is planning a vacation to the Maldives a trip that approximately costs around $15,000 and out of curiosity I asked if he has ever been to the Kenyan coast. Surprisingly he has never been, a weekend trip to the Kenyan coast would approximately cost $5,000 compared with the one in Maldives, cost is clearly not a factor. I am a big believer of _Charity begins at home_ and in most cases _traveling starts from home_ ,maybe I've pushed it a little too far but before you plan a trip to see the Louvre pyramid or the leaning tower of Pisa have you ever visited your nearest museum or a historical building ?
Essentially, traveling is a portfolio that is built over time. Therefore, you start small through local travel.

## Places to visit in Kenya
### **1. Lake Nakuru National Park**

This beautiful gem is located in the south side of Nakuru town. The Lake is famous for pink flamingoes that get their color from the algae that grows abundantly in the lake.

When you hear L. Bogoria, boiling water comes to mind,right? This is right, but apart from the geysers, the alkaline lake is home to one of the largest populations of lesser flamingoes. Together, the geysers and the flamingoes bring such harmony to the famous Lake Bogoria National Reserve where tourist can enjoy eggs boiled naturally by mother nature.

 ensure its existence today. It is quite a sanctuary within Nairobi area offiering family friendly activities such as;

This is a vast area to cover and will somewhat seem like an ambigous destination.However, that is the beauty of the region, it offers so much diversity that you can always visit and bee amazed everytime. From the famous Fort Jesus to the infamous Gedi ruins, the coastal area is so rich in culture, food and ofcourse the white sandy beaches of the Indian Ocean.
Accomodation is nothing to worry about as there are a lot of options the region has to offer at competitive prices, and being a local tourist lots of discounts.
The region also boasts of the Old town of Lamu where the Swahili people still practice their traditions including the famous donkey races and _Mashua_ competitions.
Whatever the time of the year, the Kenyan coast is never a dull moment.

# Finally
I hope this is finally a sign to get out of your comfort zone and travel. Life is not short but exciting if we take advantage of culture, nature and people.
